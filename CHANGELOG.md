# [4.0.0](https://github.com/knownasilya/ember-toggle/compare/v3.0.0...v4.0.0) (2017-03-16)


### Features

* Rename Addon ([0bdcc89](https://github.com/knownasilya/ember-toggle/commit/0bdcc89))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Addon is now named `ember-toggle`, make sure to update your `config/environment.js` accordingly.

_This is due to the fact that the `ember-cli-*` naming convention for Ember Addons is
meant mainly for extending the CLI in some way, which this addon doesn't do. Also it's shorter and easier to remember._
